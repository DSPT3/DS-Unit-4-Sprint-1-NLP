    "Your goal in this assignment: find the attributes of the best & worst coffee shops in the dataset. The text is fairly raw: dates in the review, extra words in the `star_rating` column, etc. You'll probably want to clean that stuff up for a better analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze the corpus of text using text visualizations of token frequency. Try cleaning the data as much as possible. Try the following techniques: \n",
    "- Lemmatization\n",
    "- Custom stopword removal\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind the attributes of good tokens. Once you have a solid baseline, layer in the star rating in your visualization(s). Key part of this assignment - produce a write-up of the attributes of the best and worst coffee shops. Based on your analysis, what makes the best the best and the worst the worst. Use graphs and numbesr from your analysis to support your conclusions. There should be plenty of markdown cells! :coffee:"

       "      <td>7/10/2016 Yesterday was our first visit to Quack's. Since there are not many bakeries in Austin, we are always on the look out for ANY bakery, let alone a good one. Several people had recommended this place and I really wanted to like it.... I was hoping that it was better than Bribery Bakery in Wells Branch, which we find to be just so-so.  My only positive is that I like the Hyde Park neighborhood that it is located in.  When I walked in the store and was waiting in line, I noticed the ceiling. It was disgustingly dirty. The whole place felt like it needed hosed down. As I looked into the glass cases, several things looked good. Several things were rather odd for what I normally see in a bakery. So many Vegan selections was a little off putting. Then, I saw a fly buzzing around the cookies in the case.  I was willing to overlook all of that if the pastries actually tasted good. But.... We bought 3 things: blueberry Danish, strawberry thumb print type of cookies, and peanut butter cookies. It all cost about $20. We brought them home and tried everything for breakfast this morning.  Everything tasted odd. I have never been to a bakery in my life where the items tasted so off. There is something about the dough or the butter or whatever ingredients they are using. Perhaps it just doesn't have enough sugar. Or maybe there is no sugar. The taste of the Strawberry cookies was a lot like strawberry and Crisco that left a bad aftertaste in your mouth. And it was kind of dry. The peanut butter cookies tasted like sand, were very very dry, and they had that same weird after taste. Could it be the butter they use? It makes me wonder if they know what they are doing when they are baking. Also it worries me that they are using some ingredient that I may be allergic to. And I am allergic to certain artificial sweeteners.  I just don't trust their goods now and won't be back. We live in Pflugerville, so this place is not convenient for us. But, I would have been a regular and willing to drive all the way to it if the place wasn't so grungy and the food actually tasted good.  I'm so disappointed.</td>\n",

Usually when someone suggests getting gelato I'm thinking they are either a 'hipster' or one of those 'healthy eaters' who avoids indulgent treats... Not so at TEO. I can honestly say it is the one place I've found where I truly choose to seek out Gelato over ice cream.  It reminds me so much of what I ate internationally. So rich and creamy.  Some of my personal favorites (though it's so difficult to pick just one) are the goat cheese and cherry - it is incredible and a must try! Coffee and oreo, nuts, whiskey pecan, coconut Nutella (can you think gelato mounds bar?) - heck they're all deliciously amazing!  You won't be disappointed.  They have a nice little patio with a fireplace outside and lots of newspapers to read inside. Even a TV if there's a major sporting event (usually European, so think world cup games). Dogs are welcome. Kids are often seen here mingling among those doing business.  It's truly a neighborhood place immediately across the street from Seton Hospital.  I'm not a coffee drinker so I cannot speak to the quality of their offering in that dept. They do have hot chocolate and it is one place that serves apple cider here locally (year round). While the cider doesn't compare with cider mills' on-site cider you get in other parts of the country, it still brings back good memories. (Personally,  I'd avoid the whipped cream and carmelized topping on it because then it just tastes like a dessert drink; to me, a great cider should stand on it's own.) If you have lived where you went to apple orchards or cider mills however, you may be disappointed. It's still worth a try. Pick up a breakfast taco or two as well.  And there are always a few sandwiches available in case you are hungry. My one suggestion/wish is that they would expand ever so slightly their food menu. Sometimes I would like to get something to eat and it's not always an option especially later in the day.  But TEO is still a real gem overall.</td>\n",

There are some songs that are the same but they do always change it up. There is plenty of seating and they don't pressure you to buy anything while you watch the show. Mozart's light show is definitely something you must see when you're in Austin for the christmas time. Pre-light show</td>\n",

They are pretty well organized, although when it's busy, many people hover around the pickup window and twice I had someone else grab my drink, which was eventually rectified. Note, if the weather is lousy, there is NO inside, unless they hire you. Next time I'm in town, I'll be there.</td>\n",

I ordered a cold brew and my friend got a latte, and we sipped on them while browsing through the many selections available in store. TOMS has really upgraded and become trendy over the years - a sharp contrast to the plain grey TOMS I've had in the past. The inside area was a bit small and very quiet, and the back area had a lot of light.The outside area is spacious and faces the street; I got to sit comfortably on one of their Acapulco chairs and enjoy the breezy weather that day. Overall, I enjoyed my visit and will be back next time I'm in SOCO!</td>\n",

       "6505   7/10/2016 Yesterday was our first visit to Quack's. Since there are not many bakeries in Austin, we are always on the look out for ANY bakery, let alone a good one. Several people had recommended this place and I really wanted to like it.... I was hoping that it was better than Bribery Bakery in Wells Branch, which we find to be just so-so.  My only positive is that I like the Hyde Park neighborhood that it is located in.  When I walked in the store and was waiting in line, I noticed the ceiling. It was disgustingly dirty. The whole place felt like it needed hosed down. As I looked into the glass cases, several things looked good. Several things were rather odd for what I normally see in a bakery. So many Vegan selections was a little off putting. Then, I saw a fly buzzing around the cookies in the case.  I was willing to overlook all of that if the pastries actually tasted good. But.... We bought 3 things: blueberry Danish, strawberry thumb print type of cookies, and peanut butter cookies. It all cost about $20. We brought them home and tried everything for breakfast this morning.  Everything tasted odd. I have never been to a bakery in my life where the items tasted so off. There is something about the dough or the butter or whatever ingredients they are using. Perhaps it just doesn't have enough sugar. Or maybe there is no sugar. The taste of the Strawberry cookies was a lot like strawberry and Crisco that left a bad aftertaste in your mouth. And it was kind of dry. The peanut butter cookies tasted like sand, were very very dry, and they had that same weird after taste. Could it be the butter they use? It makes me wonder if they know what they are doing when they are baking. Also it worries me that they are using some ingredient that I may be allergic to. And I am allergic to certain artificial sweeteners.  I just don't trust their goods now and won't be back. We live in Pflugerville, so this place is not convenient for us. But, I would have been a regular and willing to drive all the way to it if the place wasn't so grungy and the food actually tasted good.  I'm so disappointed.   \n",

       "6833   7/17/2015 This place is where you want to go for Gelato in this town! Usually when someone suggests getting gelato I'm thinking they are either a 'hipster' or one of those 'healthy eaters' who avoids indulgent treats... Not so at TEO. I can honestly say it is the one place I've found where I truly choose to seek out Gelato over ice cream.  It reminds me so much of what I ate internationally. So rich and creamy.  Some of my personal favorites (though it's so difficult to pick just one) are the goat cheese and cherry - it is incredible and a must try! Coffee and oreo, nuts, whiskey pecan, coconut Nutella (can you think gelato mounds bar?) - heck they're all deliciously amazing!  You won't be disappointed.  They have a nice little patio with a fireplace outside and lots of newspapers to read inside. Even a TV if there's a major sporting event (usually European, so think world cup games). Dogs are welcome. Kids are often seen here mingling among those doing business.  It's truly a neighborhood place immediately across the street from Seton Hospital.  I'm not a coffee drinker so I cannot speak to the quality of their offering in that dept. They do have hot chocolate and it is one place that serves apple cider here locally (year round). While the cider doesn't compare with cider mills' on-site cider you get in other parts of the country, it still brings back good memories. (Personally,  I'd avoid the whipped cream and carmelized topping on it because then it just tastes like a dessert drink; to me, a great cider should stand on it's own.) If you have lived where you went to apple orchards or cider mills however, you may be disappointed. It's still worth a try. Pick up a breakfast taco or two as well.  And there are always a few sandwiches available in case you are hungry. My one suggestion/wish is that they would expand ever so slightly their food menu. Sometimes I would like to get something to eat and it's not always an option especially later in the day.  But TEO is still a real gem overall.                                                                                                   \n",

       "2368   12/4/2013 Been shopping local here for years and realized I needed to say how good it is. Won't repeat the many other reviewers so adding a special note of what happened yesterday.  The owner, Jamie Anderson, took time to go over the different coffee makers, how to make a great cup of coffee, listened to my story and recommended  a perfect process for my lifestyle.  Best of all when I said I needed to go off and think about all this before I buy...he was cool and understood that.  Went back later that day and purchased. Having a cup now. Perfect.  Have to add - love those old hardwood floors.

       "4357   7/3/2015 2 check-ins Listed in Best of Austin Great, unique, and charming coffee shop.    Place itself is super cute - squirrel wall paper, exposed pipes, poured concrete, an antique television aquarium!  Staff is great!  Very helpful and friendly!!  They have parking and outdoor seating!  I had their house specialty - the Ohayo (a brown sugar cappuccino), which was great!  I also tried one of their Japanese-inspired breakfast toasts - the Nori Tama - which was INSANELY GOOD.    This charming eastside coffee shop is so worth trying.

       "1060   3/8/2016 If you ever are looking to grab a cup of coffee you should give this place a try at least once. I have not had many things here as I feel the only thing I need is the Iced Mojo, but based purely on the Iced Mojo itself I highly recommend it. No need for creamer or sugar it is good to go!  The staff/employees do provide the service expected but do not go above and beyond.  Cozy environment, not as hipster as some of the Epochs closer to downtown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "923    6/29/2016 1 check-in I have been DROOLING over the photos of the Mr. Ring for a few days now. I FINALLY got to try their gelato and Mr. Ring...  OH. MY. GOSH. It was delicious. I finished my Mr. Ring before I even left the parking lot! I love gelato and I love chocolate covered anything...so this is the perfect marriage of my 2 favorite things.  I sampled some of their gelatos and they were so delicious! The pineapple gelato is dairy free and tastes like I'm eating a pineapple! YAS.  What's even more awesome about this place is that their gelato is non-GMO and artificial color free! WOO HOO. I'm a total convert. I'll be walking over here so I can eat one Mr. Ring there and eat one on my walk home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "1357   3/23/2015 The atmosphere is great and the service is really nice. Honestly the only reason for the three stars in the cost. I'm not saying it isn't worth it, I'm just saying that it is hard to justify the fact that even a small cup of coffee with nothing special approaches $3.  There are many great Coffee options in Austin, and this is one of them, just know that the cost is high before you go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "1852   11/11/2014 1 check-in Mojo...Hmm what's mojo? And why don't I have some already?    It was quite perfectly  a slow roasted coffee which produces a creamy texture.

       "249    12/20/2015 1 check-in I am reviewing their light show! Mozart's light show is absolutely amazing. It blows my mind every year, and it's different every year! There are some songs that are the same but they do always change it up. There is plenty of seating and they don't pressure you to buy anything while you watch the show. Mozart's light show is definitely something you must see when you're in Austin for the christmas time.

       "3339   2/1/2016 2 check-ins This place is very convenient if you are staying at the Hotel San Jose. I had coffees and Americanos every day of my visit. They are pretty well organized, although when it's busy, many people hover around the pickup window and twice I had someone else grab my drink, which was eventually rectified. Note, if the weather is lousy, there is NO inside, unless they hire you. Next time I'm in town, I'll be there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "5160   5/23/2016 1 check-in Listed in Austin Coffee What an adorable little shop! I finally had the chance to visit and I enjoyed my time here. I ordered a cold brew and my friend got a latte, and we sipped on them while browsing through the many selections available in store. TOMS has really upgraded and become trendy over the years - a sharp contrast to the plain grey TOMS I've had in the past. The inside area was a bit small and very quiet, and the back area had a lot of light.The outside area is spacious and faces the street; I got to sit comfortably on one of their Acapulco chairs and enjoy the breezy weather that day. Overall, I enjoyed my visit and will be back next time I'm in SOCO!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       " 11/9/2016 1 check-in Listed in In Search of Fantastic Coffee So, I really didn't want to write this review. I didn't want to tell anyone how awesome The Factory - Cafe With a Soul is because I don't want it overrun and super busy with no place to sit like so many other decent coffee shops in Austin. I happened to come in here with a friend mid-week and we sat here for several hours, enjoying the peace and quiet, the atmosphere, and the awesome coffee.  This place is a little eclectic - lots of peculiar art, books, games, knick-knacks, and an almost head-scratching drink and food menu. Waffles and pop tarts...and beer? And... coffee mojitos? Well, it works. Whatever is going on here, it works fabulously. They serve Stumptown Coffee, which as someone from the Northwest, I totally appreciate. They also brew coffee correctly. There is not a hint of bitterness or overcooked milk going on here. The iPad ordering screens are mostly cool, (although they need more options for customization) and the million different types of seating, (couches, pillows, swings, big chairs, little chairs, bar seating, regular tables) is both delightful and refreshing. The baristas make foam art - something that I have only seen at Houndstooth here in Austin. Hanging out here was a wonderful experience - this is a five star establishment, the best coffee house I've been to in Austin, and I will be back - time and time again. Double espresso with tonic water. Beautiful Macha A beary lovely mocha!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      4\n",

       " 10/25/2016 1 check-in Check out this video for a review! youtube.com/watch?v=N8Ki…  Cool new place in Austin! It's always great to see places doing something new and unique. The seating arrangements and atmosphere are definitely fun. One thing is that there's no internet, so don't plan on coming here to get stuff done!  You get to order on an ipad! yay.  Pros: - the drink choices are really great. You can get something that you want. You can even get beer here. - great for pictures and enjoying some time off. Sit on a swing ... while playing chase. - parking is plentiful in the plaza area. - friendly baristas  Cons: - food menu isn't too big, but that's okay. Not gluten free for the wife. - very pricey. If you need a place to come on a weekly basis, you're going to need to be a balla.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              4\n",

       " 12/2/2016 What a fantastic atmosphere. I dropped in to catch up on some work and found a fantastic atmosphere and a great staff. I wish I could work here every day. I had the Darling pour-over and olive bread, and camped out near the pop-art fabric fire in the fireplace nook. Wallace (owner) and his team were spot-on with service and help. Full disclosure: The place is so beautiful on the inside that I Instagrammed it - couldn't help it, I claimed it for my own, like dozens of other folks. Highly recommended, so get here when you can!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             4\n",
       " 10/27/2016 2 check-ins Listed in \"Nuptial Coffee Bliss!\", Anderson Lane is the new Black Oh hey, the pro vs con format. I've never used that before. Let's try it:  Pros: 1. This place is cooler than I thought. 2. It's open until 2am. No, really. 3. They have beer & wine. I didn't know that until I saw the beer taps. They offered me a sample.  Cons: 1. If you have to describe The Factory with one word, it probably won't be \"inexpensive.\"  I don't think they're shooting for the \"Sixth Coffeehouse on Anderson Lane but with Flash\" title here, I think they really want to be the official bistro in the neighborhood - far more casual than Bartlett or Hopdoddy, but with a lot more flair than Tea Haus or Starbuck Evenings. Staying open until 2am is a good start, and let's see if they add more to the menu. Remember, no one thought that gentrified Walmart would do well either.  In the meantime, have fun with those chicken & waffles, and their colorful matcha-infused coffees. I'm only interested in straight black, and their pourover Stumptown is great stuff. Try the $5 pop tart at least once, mainly because you can. And then let's meet back here in a couple of weeks, just to see what's been tweaked. This place defines hipster man-cave. I liked the long table with 1/2 bar chairs & stools, & the cool plates & cups. There's a $5 pop tart.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         4\n",

       " 11/2/2016 2 check-ins Love this place!  5 stars for cleanliness 5 stars for fun ambiance/ open space 5 stars for ample seating and comfort 5 stars for convenient parking 5 stars for attentive employees and fast service  I am definitely a fan Cafe w/ a Soul. I finally found a coffee shop I can study at without sacrificing comfort (Starbucks' uncomfortable chairs). The coffee shop endorses social connection, hence, wifi  isn't available. It makes me really happy that a lot of students hang out here with their book bags and laptops and we can all just study in peace and somehow quiet (the background music can get pretty loud). Unfortunately, there will always be that kid who's obnoxiously loud and would like the whole world to know her business. Seriously, unless it's something intriguing or educational, no one cares. In addition, as much \"fun\" as this place looks, it's not child friendly. So parents, make sure your children do not hit the table in front of it and knock out the chess set. Lastly, the sex images in the bathrooms are definitely not appropriate for children.  The ambiance is very much like Austin-- very eccentric and hip! Food and drink presentations are on par. Drink prices are reasonable and similar to good ole Starbucks. But unlike you're typical coffee shop, they have real food such as chicken and waffles.  My favorite about this place is the cleanliness. The employees do a good job maintaining the place. Also, as I watch them make coffees, they do it with fines as if they're creating some type of art, it's pretty cool (in my opinion).  In conclusion, Cafe w/ a Soul is probably the best coffee shop I've ever been to. It's like studying in my own home but away from distractions. I'm awake!

       " 10/15/2016 This place is really nice. They have done a great job... It's the type of place that you could spend hours in. They have a small menu right now, but their drinks, waffles, and pastries are really well made. We'll definitely be coming back soon.... like tomorrow.

       " 10/25/2016 1 check-in Ok, let's try this approach...  Pros: Music Seating Decor General ambiance Service  Cons: iPad ordering (I'm a crotchety old man, kids) Limited coffee menu, or menu in general Relatively expensive Food is pretty but lackluster  I'm still sitting here as I type this and I'm less than overjoyed with the experience, sadly. The space and vibe are great but not quite familiar or intimate enough to beat out a place like Genuine Joe down the street. It seems like they bank on the vibe, and fall short the rest of the way. (This would be a great hangout for the artsy/design crowd having a collaborative meeting.)  The staff is great but the iPad ordering system limits your required interaction with them. They take pride in no wifi to increase interaction but then use iPads instead of people?  Seating is ample, if cramped in a surprisingly large space.  But the food, kids. So pretty, but again lackluster. I tried the Pop+art ($5) and the Nutella Waffle ($4.75) and they both sit on their respective tiny awkward plates half eaten. (Yes the plate liners are cute) The waffle is a great idea but the waffle itself  has no flavor and there's no delight. The tart is similar - the pastry crust is much too thick compared to the Smuckers jam tasting filling and it is essentially just pure sugar. The pastry itself doesn't even taste buttery or crisp. Meh. There appears to be no soul in this confectionary.  Coffee- passable. But at $4 for a cortado and a $1.50 up-charge for almond milk- I'll pick another place.  I get why the reviews are so good here, but there are much better places nearby for that \"cafe with a soul\" feel. This feels like an ACL pop-up. Going for that?  Great, come here.

       " 10/10/2016 This place is so cute. New favorite coffee spot on Burnet/in Northcross. Almost wish I was still in grad school,  so I would have an excuse to be there everyday.  Amazing coffee and best chicken & waffles ever! The chicken was seasoned perfectly and made for a delicious savory brunch (with the house made slaw they give you on the side). The olive oil cake was also awesome, light and sweet. Perfect coffee companion. My husband and I will definitely be back, as we loved everything and felt it was all very reasonable priced. Olive oil cake, chicken & waffle and 15-minutes-of-fame coffee! So good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      4\n",

       " 12/2/2016 A cafe that doesn't have Wifi but makes you order from an iPad. Seriously? $2 extra for almond milk?! The latte was already $5 for 12 oz. Don't expect to have a lot of Vegan customers. There's a serious lack of customer service for the  overpriced food and beverages.  You order from an iPad, and they call out your drink. There is no interaction between the customer and employee, and they still expect a tip? This cafe also advertises that they have games. There are two games, chess and tick tax toe. It is a beautiful cafe, with very cool furnishings. However I wont be going back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      4\n",
       " 11/10/2016 3 check-ins This place has been shown on my social media for days so i finally visited! One of THE cutest and artistic looking coffeeshops I have ever visited. You can self order which is nice because you can take your time and look at the pictures to help you decide! I especially liked how pictures were shown so I knew which coffee/tea came out aesthetically  I ordered the famous matcha green latte and i dont usually drink coffee but it went beyond my expectations. They give you a good amount and its creamy and sweet. Only downside is no wifi.. So hard to study here.

       " 10/7/2016 1 check-in Came in on the first day of opening, hours currently 6am-2pm. At some point they'll stay open till 12 midnight. I think this might be the most beautiful cafe in Austin, the interior is charming, snazzy, cozy. There's even a pair of swings to sit on while you enjoy your coffee and play a game of chess. I ordered the Marymint Monroe, basically a mint mojito. It's been a while since I've been to Philz coffee so it's hard to compare, but I think the Marymint is a little creamier. Also had the banana nutella waffle, bananas and nutella are always a winning combination, can't go wrong there. No wifi yet but I'm sure it will come soon. Friendly staff, delicious offerings, antique filament lightbulbs and best of all, Bieber and MJ high above on a mural watching over you. This place is aces.

       " 10/9/2016 1 check-in I am very impressed with this place. The food portions were so perfect and not mention delicious! The waffle architects (staff) were all so accommodating and nice. We were able to talk to one of the owners for a bit and he was very helpful with his recommendations and accurate. I highly recommend this place. I will definitely be coming back when I am in Austin again. Nutella and Banana waffles. Chicken and Waffles, Olive Oil Pound Cake, and Milk Tea! Yummy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       4\n",
       " 11/21/2016 1 check-in This place is fantastic! Ideal place for grabbing a frothy matcha latte and a chicken & waffle. A bit different in the way that you order. Definitely a nice hang-out for millenials or anyone who works in the area and is on a lunch break. Wifi is within reach but they don't have it themselves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              4\n",
       " 11/2/2016 Interesting new coffee place with a vibe that blends posh, hipster, and comfy.  Medium roasted beans have a milder, sweeter flavor than your typical Starbucks espresso shot, so be aware that the coffee tastes less bitter but packs more of a caffeine punch!

       " 11/13/2016 Beautiful eccentric coffee shop with a library of peculiar books.  Swings, couches, and pillow corners for cuddle puddles.  Coffee with mint and ways you've never imagined coffee could be made. Try the matcha green tea with soy, creamiest matcha I've ever had.  First time here and already my favorite coffee bar so far.

       " 10/13/2016 1 check-in I really enjoyed my visit here. I ordered the cortado and chicken waffle. Both were excellent.  The space is very Instagram worthy.  Awesome mural. Staff was very friendly too and I loved the iPad ordering system. Chicken waffle and cortado paired with sparkling water to cleanse the palate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 4\n",
       " 11/9/2016 Really cute and heavily hipster atmosphere. We tried this place late night on Saturday and enjoyed the first visit. You will want to try their swing for sure. Seating space is somewhat limited and no wifi is available, so be aware. This is more like a place for you to enjoy its atmosphere. Drinks were good, though make sure you have enough in your bank account because their drinks are probably not for broke college students. That swing!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       4\n",
