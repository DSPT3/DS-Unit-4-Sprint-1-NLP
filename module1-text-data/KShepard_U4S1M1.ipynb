I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make brunch so we headed out in search of chicken and waffles.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seat and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold brew coffee, chicken and waffles and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The chicken and waffles wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the waffle was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.  A great place to be cozy and chat with your friends, a date or read a book. Chicken and waffles Pop tart Coffee See all photos from Carmela S. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul</td>\n",

       "2   1 check-in Listed in Brunch Spots I loved the eclectic and homey plush decor and who doesn't want to swing and drink their coffee?  I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make brunch so we headed out in search of chicken and waffles.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seat and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold brew coffee, chicken and waffles and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The chicken and waffles wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the waffle was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.  A great place to be cozy and chat with your friends, a date or read a book. Chicken and waffles Pop tart Coffee See all photos from Carmela S. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul    \n",

       "2   1 check-in Listed in Brunch Spots I loved the eclectic and homey plush decor and who doesn't want to swing and drink their coffee?  I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make brunch so we headed out in search of chicken and waffles.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seat and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold brew coffee, chicken and waffles and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The chicken and waffles wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the waffle was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.  A great place to be cozy and chat with your friends, a date or read a book. Chicken and waffles Pop tart Coffee See all photos from Carmela S. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul    \n",
       "3   Very cool decor! Good drinks Nice seating  However...  Just about everything is overpriced. $1.50 extra for 3 ounces of Almond Milk in a cortado. No WiFi Music is a bit loud and the mix is odd.  Pleasant French oldies followed by loud techno. Several tables were dirty when we got there. Service is average.

       "4  1 check-in They are located within the Northcross mall shopping center facing east toward Burnet Rd with plenty of parking. I loved their computerized user friendly ordering system, it made it easy me to pick & choose all the items I wanted to try. I ordered pop tart, chicken & waffles, strawberry waffles (photos uploaded). This place is ideal for ordering a few dishes to share with your group. Seating is limited since this place is fairly new with lots of visitors. Arrive early and be prepared to wait a bit if you with a large grop.

I love that they have multiple entrances, along with gigantic windows. Good place to spend all day at without bearing the guilt that you're wasting away the free sunlight! Their windows make it possible to be productive and enjoy a pretty day when it's not possible to sit outside. They've got a decent sized patio space--which I'm quite excited about come April or the early summertime.  The service was quick, and the staff seems to be active in keeping the place clean which is a plus! They seemed very friendly and welcoming so no complaints there.  Parking wasn't bad at all. The guy before me took the last spot in their lot so I resorted to street parking but it didn't take long. Was able to find a really good spot in no time.  Now, for the two reasons that knocked off the fifth star that I would've given them:  1) the music was really loud at times (most of the time). I was there to converse and it was really hard to hear myself, let alone my company.  2) at 7pm on a Sunday, there was limited seatings. I wish they would add a few more tables or chairs. Plus, I think I witnessed a lighter than usual crowd since it is the Sunday before spring break ends.  This was my first non-Starbucks coffee house visit in Austin. I'll be exploring other locations and will be comparing them to this. So far, I like Thunderbird a lot cause I don't feel the heavy presence of the elitist hipster culture here.</td>\n",

       "      <td>3 check-ins ROTD 6/20/2015 Listed in My reviews of the day Space: The building and the outside patios (and lights) are all beautiful and well constructed. It's very modern and it's not a converted strip mall, like Strange Brew down the street. The space is clean, well-designed, and in a part of town that is starving for coffee shops. There are flowers and actual landscaping, etc.  Food: There's a Vera Cruz taco truck with some of the best tacos in Austin right in the parking lot, and they serve East Side Pies pizza inside by the slice until it runs out. I tried the migas tacos and really liked them.    Coffee: There are lots of coffees (draft coffee!) and beers, and I look forward to coming back. It's less down and out than Strange Brew, which seems to have switched gears to live music, which is fine.  Noise: The outdoor music was a little loud, as was the construction noise happening around us at 2:00 on a Saturday. But I went the first week and I'm sure these issues have all resolved themselves now.  Issues: The only issues are 1) the parking. There seem to have been lots of complaints about that already. 2) good space for the kids. There are lots of families visiting, and so it would be neat to have a little slide or toy area or something that more and more places have these days.  The spot sort of reminds me of the Thunderbird on Manor Road. I would recommend it to anyone, and look forward to going back. Veracruz Tacos</td>\n",

       "2986  1 check-in Really liked this place -- definitely see myself coming back again. I'm not a coffee connoisseur or anything, but their cappuccino is the best I've had in a while. I love that they have multiple entrances, along with gigantic windows. Good place to spend all day at without bearing the guilt that you're wasting away the free sunlight! Their windows make it possible to be productive and enjoy a pretty day when it's not possible to sit outside. They've got a decent sized patio space--which I'm quite excited about come April or the early summertime.  The service was quick, and the staff seems to be active in keeping the place clean which is a plus! They seemed very friendly and welcoming so no complaints there.  Parking wasn't bad at all. The guy before me took the last spot in their lot so I resorted to street parking but it didn't take long. Was able to find a really good spot in no time.  Now, for the two reasons that knocked off the fifth star that I would've given them:  1) the music was really loud at times (most of the time). I was there to converse and it was really hard to hear myself, let alone my company.  2) at 7pm on a Sunday, there was limited seatings. I wish they would add a few more tables or chairs. Plus, I think I witnessed a lighter than usual crowd since it is the Sunday before spring break ends.  This was my first non-Starbucks coffee house visit in Austin. I'll be exploring other locations and will be comparing them to this. So far, I like Thunderbird a lot cause I don't feel the heavy presence of the elitist hipster culture here.   \n",
       "2029   This place is so cute. New favorite coffee spot on Burnet/in Northcross. Almost wish I was still in grad school,  so I would have an excuse to be there everyday.  Amazing coffee and best chicken & waffles ever! The chicken was seasoned perfectly and made for a delicious savory brunch (with the house made slaw they give you on the side). The olive oil cake was also awesome, light and sweet. Perfect coffee companion. My husband and I will definitely be back, as we loved everything and felt it was all very reasonable priced. Olive oil cake, chicken & waffle and 15-minutes-of-fame coffee! So good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

It's the less dingy, smoke free, and friendlier version of the same floor plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "7163  Let me stress. People talk about this being a \"coffee shop\", but this is a BAKERY and not a coffee shop.  The coffee is not very good. There were hints when I ordered a cappuccino, and I was asked if I wanted a 12 ounce, 16 ounce, or 20 ounce cup. The coffee comes out of an automated machine much that you might find in a Starbucks.  The bakery stuff may be excellent, but don't go there for the coffee. Heck, go to Epic or Monkey's Nest. Both have excellent coffee and serve Russell's bakery                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "6437  1 check-in I come here often to enjoy a cup of black coffee and there 'Italian\" sandwich....usually because it's quiet and they provide free wifi on the weekends, which I've found some other coffee joints refuse to do(radio cough cough).

As I'm listening through my headphones it sounds a little mellow, but there's definitely a drum set. Prices are reasonable here and that Italian sandwich is always delicious.

       "5522  3 check-ins ROTD 6/20/2015 Listed in My reviews of the day Space: The building and the outside patios (and lights) are all beautiful and well constructed. It's very modern and it's not a converted strip mall, like Strange Brew down the street. The space is clean, well-designed, and in a part of town that is starving for coffee shops. There are flowers and actual landscaping, etc.  Food: There's a Vera Cruz taco truck with some of the best tacos in Austin right in the parking lot, and they serve East Side Pies pizza inside by the slice until it runs out. I tried the migas tacos and really liked them.    Coffee: There are lots of coffees (draft coffee!) and beers, and I look forward to coming back. It's less down and out than Strange Brew, which seems to have switched gears to live music, which is fine.  Noise: The outdoor music was a little loud, as was the construction noise happening around us at 2:00 on a Saturday. But I went the first week and I'm sure these issues have all resolved themselves now.  Issues: The only issues are 1) the parking. There seem to have been lots of complaints about that already. 2) good space for the kids. There are lots of families visiting, and so it would be neat to have a little slide or toy area or something that more and more places have these days.  The spot sort of reminds me of the Thunderbird on Manor Road. I would recommend it to anyone, and look forward to going back.

       "6111   Love finding coffee spots. After a disappointing dinner at Korea House, we headed over here for some tea. I ordered a Coconut Chai tea (only comes in a pot). The Barista was really friendly. I loved the cozy feeling of the area. Thanks Austin!

       " 1 check-in Note: Do not come here if you're looking for a place to work remotely! There is no WiFi and no outlets. Staff says they are hoping to create an environment where people socialize and enjoy each other's company rather than being on their phones.  For a spot to catch up with friends over coffee and pastries, I highly recommend coming here! There is ample seating, an open layout, and a lot to look at  and talk about including wooden swings, books and a chess board on a table, and a cute corner of pillows in another corner.  They serve coffee drinks, waffles, and pastries. The pop tart was extremely sweet, so much so that I was unable to finish even half. Their cortado was pretty good. The food and drinks are quite pricey here, which makes me question returning.  Presentation and ambience wise, I give this place 5 stars! But price and food, probably a 3.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    4\n",
       " 1 check-in Checked out The Factory this past Sunday with my husband. We wanted to try their delicious looking waffles and were definitely not disappointed.  Husband ordered an iced coffee drink that was delicious, but it wasn't as good as my Golden Age of Milk Tea, well worth the 10 minute wait for the tea to steep.  We both ordered the Nutella Waffle and it was perfect. From the wood plate with the AMAZING paper liner printed with a famous person and an inspirational quote from them. I wanted just the paper because it was so cute and well done. The waffle is basically half a waffle, spread with Nutella and a layer of bananas, then folded in half. While small, it was a perfect amount, the bananas balancing out the sweetness of the Nutella. The waffle itself was crisp perfection, providing a crunch to the meal. The menu is very limited: there was the nutella waffle and a fried chicken waffle. I'm hoping they'll eventually serve other waffles, but totally respect their decision to start small.  The space is gorgeous. From the swings to the mural above the bar, everything looks meticulously planned out. And here is where my biggest advice comes: this place is really not for kids. The way the seating is set up is really for larger people and there is definitely no place for high chairs. While there is giant magnetic poetry on one of the columns, a crazy chair outside and a couple of table games, the giant chess set looks risky for grabby kids. If you have a well-behaved child who can handle it, I would think its fine. However, I watched several families come in and either leave or order to go, commenting it wasn't the best space for them. While this doesn't bother me (I love kidless spaces), it might be jarring to someone expecting to have brunch with the family.  I am so excited to become a regular here! Great new spot!     4\n",
       " The store has A+ decoration, but honestly, the coffee it made is not as good as other coffee shop in the surrounding area. It has no wifi, so good for hang out with friend or read a book. Not sure why there is no restroom here. Ordering app is well made, but probably won't be my coffee stop because of the quality of food/coffee. It's selling you the atmosphere they created, so don't expected the food/coffee. Probably would be a good date spot. 8 dollar tiny chicken and waffle.

       "Interesting new coffee place with a vibe that blends posh, hipster, and comfy.  Medium roasted beans have a milder, sweeter flavor than your typical Starbucks espresso shot, so be aware that the coffee tastes less bitter but packs more of a caffeine punch!

       " 1 check-in Very cute cafe! I think from the moment I stepped in, there really wasn't anything I didn't find cute at The Factory. From their decor to their cups, everything was really cute. It's really the perfect place for a catching up with friends or a coffee date.  When you go order, there's really the least amount of interaction ever with the workers. You just pick your order on an iPad and they'll call your order out after for you to pick up at the counter. The whole thing's pretty novel honestly. I got the Viva Matcha Latte and it was so good! Perfect amount of sweetness and perfect temperature. I went on a cold night and this cafe is just so cozy, it was such a great combination. They have these swings as well which were pretty fun to sit on honestly.  Prices are what I would expect for a cafe like this, not super cheap, but not too pricey. There's no wifi here, so if you want to study, maybe this isn't the right place. But overall, very nice atmosphere!

       "I was so pleasantly surprised by this place! I only went because I had time to kill and they were the only coffee shop nearby open until 2 am. But I'm so glad I tried it out. It's not your typical Austin coffee shop. The quality of the drinks here was top notch, and they offer unique food and drinks. I had the macha latte (I think that's what it was called) and it was fantastic! The people were so friendly, the decor was beautiful, with plenty of comfortable seating (including swings from the ceiling!), and it was just the perfect place to chill with friends. I'll definitely be coming back!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         4\n",
       " 1 check-in This place is fantastic! Ideal place for grabbing a frothy matcha latte and a chicken & waffle. A bit different in the way that you order. Definitely a nice hang-out for millenials or anyone who works in the area and is on a lunch break. Wifi is within reach but they don't have it themselves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             4\n",
       " 1 check-in Listed in 2016 - The Third Time is a Charm! The Factory has A+ decor and a very innovative interactionless (tablet) ordering system. This allows you to look up what to get without feeling pressured by a barista staring at you waiting for you to order. The eclectic selection of tables, couches, and swings (?!) inside with a small kiddy corner appeal to many different types of tastes. This is seriously a cool place to hang out.  However, when it comes to the coffee and food, it's rather not cheap. The waffles range from $4-$8, and coffee is between $3.50 and $5. The quality of the coffee is not yet up to par with other coffee mainstays in Austin, so I would probably not choose to come here just for coffee. However, it is a CUTE date place and I know that M and I will probably come back to chat, people-watch, or read books.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  4\n",
       " 3 check-ins This place has been shown on my social media for days so i finally visited! One of THE cutest and artistic looking coffeeshops I have ever visited. You can self order which is nice because you can take your time and look at the pictures to help you decide! I especially liked how pictures were shown so I knew which coffee/tea came out aesthetically  I ordered the famous matcha green latte and i dont usually drink coffee but it went beyond my expectations. They give you a good amount and its creamy and sweet. Only downside is no wifi.. So hard to study here.
